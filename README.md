A hacky [Budgie](https://budgie-desktop.org/home/) extension for the [ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/).

* Based on the Cinnamon version in the ulauncher repo.

You can do session actions like reboot/logout/shutdown via typing "exit".

## Internal Commands

This script makes use of `systemctl` (systemd) commands to do the actual work. If you beleive there are better commands to use, let me know.

## TODO

* Update screenshot.
* Give proper credit
